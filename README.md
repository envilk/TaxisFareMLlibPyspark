#Apache Spark Software Technology Study Project

This repository contains the code of the Jupyter Notebook that we worked with and the Latex's Report about the Technology Study Project that we did.

The main purpose of the project is to use a unified analytics engine (Apache Spark) to compare how clustering works with machine learning and how the technology works itself.
